# Bugfix log

## BUG-0001 — Partner sign-off required for close

- **Status:** FIXED-PENDING-QA
- **Root cause:** `CloseWork` treated Manager as an allowed closer when `requiresPartnerSignoff` was set (`role != Partner && role != Manager`), and Manager inherited `work.close.partner` via `AllPermissions()`.
- **Fix:** Enforce Partner-only close when the flag is set; strip `PermClosePartner` from Manager's default permission set. Added `TestCloseWork_RequiresPartnerSignoff_BlocksManager`.
- **Tests:** `go test ./internal/workmgmt/...` PASS

## BUG-0002 — Segregation of duties on TL/CA verify gates

- **Status:** FIXED-PENDING-QA
- **Root cause:** Manager inherited `work.verify.tl` and `work.verify.ca` via `AllPermissions()` / hierarchy grants, so one Manager could alone advance `READY_FOR_TL_VERIFY` → `READY_FOR_CA_VERIFY` → `READY_FOR_MANAGER_CLOSE`.
- **Fix:** Strip both verify permissions from Manager defaults; hard-deny Manager on `VerifyTL`/`VerifyCA` (even with stale grants); reject CA verify when the actor is the same as the TL-pass verifier. Added `TestVerifyGates_SoD_ManagerAndSameActorCannotBoth`.
- **Tests:** `go test ./internal/workmgmt/...` PASS
